Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple Python project allows players to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game provides feedback on whether guesses are too high or too low and continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

Features
Random number generation within a specified range.
User input validation to ensure correct format.
Feedback on guesses (too high, too low, correct).
Option to play again after finishing a game.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

To run the game, use the following command:

bash code
python number_guessing_game.py
How It Works
The game generates a random number within a specified range.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the game provides feedback:
"Too high" if the guess is greater than the number.
"Too low" if the guess is less than the number.
"Correct" if the guess matches the number.
The game continues until the player guesses correctly.
The player is given the option to play again.
